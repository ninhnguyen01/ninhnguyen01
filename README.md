  <h3>"The men who wore these armor (Samurai) were a caste of ancient warriors. Bound to their masters for life (Daimyo). They were fearless and loyal, and lived by a sacred code (Eg., Honour: This is to be Faithful to the Words You Offer & Politeness: It's the Respect of Others). Where others embraced greed and deception, as samurai, you will only honor and sacrifice. The sharpest of their blade was match only by the purity of their heart. You remind me of those proud warriors, for you too are pure." - Taurin (Into the Badlands)</h3>

  <p><b>"Most people are no doubt familiar with the words jujutsu and judo, but how many can distinguish between them?</b> Here, I will explain the two terms and tell why judo came to take the place of jujutsu.
    <b>Many martial arts were practiced in Japan during its feudal age: the use of the lance, archery, swordsmanship and many more. Jujutsu was one such art.</b> Although jujutsu's techniques were known from the earliest times, it was not until the latter half of the sixteenth century that jujutsu was practiced and taught systematically. <b>During the Edo period (1603-1868) it developed into a complex art taught by the masters of a number of schools."</b></p>
