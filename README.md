  <h3>John Wick 2 (Theme - Honor)</h3>
  <p><b>“A marker is no small thing, John. For a man to grant a marker to another, is to bind a soul to a blood oath."
    - Santino D' Antonio to John Wick</b></p>
  <p><b>One of the martial arts seen throughout the John Wick franchise is judo, with John (Jardani) himself being its primary user</b>. Founded by Kano Jigoro, judo is well-known for its throwing techniques.
